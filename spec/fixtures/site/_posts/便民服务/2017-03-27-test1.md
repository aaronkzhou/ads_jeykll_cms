GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service.

GitHub Pages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository. To learn more about the different types of GitHub Pages sites, see "User, organization, and project pages."

You can create and publish GitHub Pages online using the Jekyll Theme Chooser. If you prefer to work locally, you can use GitHub Desktop or the command line.

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.

Guidelines for using GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages sites created after June 15, 2016 and using github.io domains are served over HTTPS. If you created your site before June 15, 2016, you can enable HTTPS support for traffic to your site.
GitHub Pages sites shouldn't be used for sensitive transactions like sending passwords or credit card numbers.

Your use of GitHub Pages is subject to the GitHub Terms of Service, including the prohibition on reselling.
